## [2.3.0] - 2019-12-06

Two subjects for this update -- "Less is more" and "expression first".

### Removed

- Remove all snippets relate to generator function due to they can simply replace by normal function snippet plus a `*` (use prettier to auto format position of asterisk).

### Changed

- Remove the curly braces in some of the snippets including `if*`, `for*`, and `while` statement (expression first, add curly braces if you need).

## [2.0.0] - 2018-08-29

A big change here, so I decide to make a version upgrade to 2.0.0. I take out many of snippets than may hava a low use rate, should not use, and object methods. If this really bother you, I feel sorry ðŸ˜¢

### Removed

- `forarry` and `rforarr` - array method like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are recommended.
- `bind`, `apply`, and `call` for function - they are function method with nice intellisense by VSCode.
- `kv`, `oa`, `oc` for object - same as above.
- `th`, `cat`, `fin` for promise - same as above.
- `pctor` and `proto` for prototype - use ES2015 `class` instead.

### Changed

- `vda`, `lda`, and `cda` become `vad`, `lad`, and `cad` - consist to how function prefix work which like a namespace.
- `import` become `impf` for import - namespace like; not like export, if import without name, it surely for a file path.
- `p` become `pr` for promise - namespace like.
- `c`, `cex`, `cm`, and `acm` become `cs`, `cse`, `csm`, and `csma` - namespace like.
- `ternary` become `ter` for ternary - make it shorter.
- Rewrite README.md, make it more short and clear.

### Added

- `prs`, `prj`, and `pra` for promise - static method `resolve`, `reject`, and `all` for Promise.

## [1.4.0] - 2018-07-06

### Removed

- Remove all test snippets, due its should not cover in this extension.

### Changed

- Combine `impas` and `impall` and remove `impall` and Fixed intellisense broken cause by syntax error.
- `dp` (destructuring parameter) to `td` (type destructuring), which a big mistake.
- remove prefill `{}` for destructuring assignment (`vda`, `lda`, `cda`) as well as type destructuring (`td`), cause both array and object support destructuring.

## [1.3.2] - 2018-05-29

### Changed

- TypeScript type default right side as empty rather than object.
- All `import`, `export`, and `require` with path now default with single quote and end semicolon (no more path intellisense issue).

## [1.3.1] - 2018-05-22

### Changed

- `trycatch` rename to `tc`.

### Fixed

- Remove `trycatch` and `tcf` redundant `(${1})`.

- Update README.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-04-08

### Added

- 3 new destructuring assigment for `var`, `let`, and `const`.

### Changed

- `var`, `let`, and `const` remove the end semicolon and adjust the cursor point.
- Make `if else` and `else if` prefix shorter to `ifel` and `elif`.
- Remove the `break` in the first `switch` case and `case` to let user determine `return` or `break` to use, but keeping the `default` `break` to ensure even if user forgot to handle it.
- Adding a space between `${1}` and `:` in `switch`, `case`, and `${1}` and `;` in `for` to make sure it does not break auto close single/double quote and parentheses.
- Remove unnecessary `${0}` in `import`.
- Change `interface, module, namespaces` to `int, mod, nam` to avoid directly same name as TypeScript / JavaScript keyword.
